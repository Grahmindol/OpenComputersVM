This allows you to creat OpenComputers virtual machines and precisely emulate player interactions with them as it would be in Minecraft world

Here's list of features for this moment:
* One click VM generation that comes with pre-configured OpenOS by default
* Unlimited count of VMs that are shown as separate windows
* Automatic screen scaling with antialiasing
* Customizing of HDD and EEPROM paths
* Simulation of sounds like HDD access, computer.beep() or ambient cooler "bshhhhhhh" with volume control
* Changing of virtual screen aspect ratio
* Limiting VM runtime RAM
* Cross-VM modem messsaging
* Toolbar hiding for best experience
* Loading/saving VMs with all component addresses, paths, etc.
* Data card component implementation
* multiple same components

Planned:
* Lua architecture switching
* a store to dowload components
* a VS-Code extention to run lua programme in the VM
* supprt all componnent of the site [https://ocandcoluadoc.ddns.net/]
* add drone/robot/microcontroler vm


Development is still in progress. But you can try the latest build located in /out/ directory without any guarantees :3
